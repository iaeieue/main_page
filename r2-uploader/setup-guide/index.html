<h3>Why this tool? ü§î</h3>
<p>In May 2022, Cloudflare launched R2 into open beta, a new S3-like object storing platform with generous free tier. It is a great alternative to AWS S3, especially for small projects and personal use. You can use the Cloudflare R2 dashboard to upload files directly, but it&#39;s kinda painful to use, this tool aims to solve these problems for the R2 users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upload big files</strong>, R2 dashboard could only upload files which size is smaller than 300Mb, R2 Uploader can handle the upload for a single file up to 100Gb in theory (huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/spurin">@spurin</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Image compression</strong>, lots of users would just use R2 as a CDN, so we added this function to make the images load faster.</li>
<li><strong>Easily jump between multiple buckets</strong>, setup multiple workers for different buckets, and switch between them fast.</li>
<li><strong>Sync configs across devices safely</strong>, you can login with GitHub and sync your configs, all data is AES encrypted locally before sending to our database.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cloudflare account</li>
<li>Cloudflare R2 Subscription (has a free quota)</li>
<li>Cloudflare Workers Subscription (free plan would be enough)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://r2-cf-api.jw1.dev/dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Set up the R2 bucket üì¶</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>On the left panel, there is a section called &quot;R2&quot;. Click on it.</li>
<li>Create a new bucket by clicking on the &quot;Create Bucket&quot; button. (You will need to input the bucket name)</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&#39;s it, now we set up the workers.</p>
<h3>Set up the Worker üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3>
<p>A Worker is like the backend of a website, it allows the R2 Uploader to communicate with the R2 bucket. <strong>This is the most important part of the setup, so please follow the steps carefully.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Dashboard</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the left panel, there is a section called &quot;Workers &amp; Pages&quot;. Click on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the &quot;Create Application&quot; button and the click on the &quot;Create Worker&quot; button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So now Cloudflare will automatically generate a name for your Worker, you can either enter a name you like or leave it as it is. Ignore that code preview section, and now click the &quot;Deploy&quot; button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the button &quot;Edit code&quot;, now you will see a code editor, paste code from this js file: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jw-12138/r2-uploader-example-worker/main/dist/worker.js">worker.js</a>.<br>This is also <a href="https://github.com/jw-12138/r2-uploader-example-worker">open sourced</a>, you can always <a href="https://github.com/jw-12138/r2-uploader-example-worker?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use">build the code yourself</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now click on the &quot;Save and Deploy&quot; button, you will see a URL on top of the page, copy it to somewhere like a notepad, <strong>we will need it later</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to the worker page, go to the &quot;Settings&quot; and then click the &quot;Variable&quot; on the left side.</p>
<p><img src="https://r2-cf-api.jw1.dev/r2_page.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>First we focus on the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; section, we need to add a key value pair for the Worker to read as a configuration. Click on the &quot;Add variable&quot; button, and then enter the variable name as &quot;AUTH_KEY_SECRET&quot; and the value is a random string, you can generate one <a href="https://www.avast.com/random-password-generator">here</a>, click &quot;Save and deploy&quot;. Remember to save the value somewhere, <strong>we will need it later</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://r2-cf-api.jw1.dev/workers_api_key_setup.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Now we scroll down to the &quot;R2 Bucket Bindings&quot; section, click on the &quot;Add binding&quot; button, and then enter the variable name as &quot;R2_BUCKET&quot; and the value is the name of the bucket you created earlier, click &quot;Save and deploy&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="https://r2-cf-api.jw1.dev/r2_bindings_to_worker.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you go to the Worker URL now, you will see a &quot;Hello R2!&quot; message, that means the worker is working as expected.</p>
<p>Now we have set up the worker, we can now set up the uploader.</p>
<h3>Set up the Uploader üóÑÔ∏è</h3>
<p>Phew, we&#39;ve come a long way, now we are going to set up the uploader, which is the web interface for the R2 bucket.</p>
<p><img src="https://r2-cf-api.jw1.dev/eFeFgOgn_bXLbpYs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Remember the Worker URL and the random string we saved earlier? We will need them now.</p>
<p>In R2 Uploader, we call the Worker URL as the &quot;Endpoint&quot; and the random string as the &quot;API Key&quot;. Enter the Endpoint and the API key, ignore the custom domain for now and click &quot;Save to LocalStorage&quot;.</p>
<p>Now you can upload and manage your files in the R2 bucket!</p>
<p><img src="https://r2-cf-api.jw1.dev/p3eqM3JOpcDfzXdi.png" alt="upload files with the uploader"></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 2rem">üéâ</span></p>
<p>R2 Uploader <strong>does not</strong> store your Endpoints or API keys in the cloud, it is stored in your browser&#39;s LocalStorage, which means it is only accessible by you. All the traffic goes through the Worker and the R2 bucket you just created.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We use <code>showDirectoryPicker</code> API to make the folder upload possible, if the <code>Choose Folder</code> button doesn&#39;t show up, it simply means that your browser does not support this API. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showDirectoryPicker">showDirectoryPicker on MDN</a>)</p>
<h3>For private use üîí</h3>
<p>By default, the Worker will allow all the GET requests to go through, which means anyone can access your file if they know the URL.</p>
<p>If you want to make your bucket private, you can do so by adding a new variable in the Worker settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the worker page, go to the &quot;Settings&quot; and then click the &quot;Variable&quot; on the left side.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;Edit variable&quot; and &quot;Add variable&quot; button, then enter the variable name as &quot;PRIVATE_BUCKET&quot; and the value is &quot;true&quot;, click &quot;Save and deploy&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will make the Worker to check the <code>x-api-key</code> header for every request, and only allow the request with the correct API key to go through.</p>
<p>If you want the bucket to be public again, just delete the variable.</p>
<h3>Set up a custom domain üåê</h3>
<p>By default, the Worker URL should be working right away, unless you want the url to be a little bit clean or, you live in China (or maybe some other country). Unfortunately, the domain name <code>workers.dev</code> is blocked in China, so we need to set up a custom domain.</p>
<p>Workers and R2 both supports custom domain, and we just need one of them to make the R2 work in China.</p>
<p><strong>For Workers:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>On the left panel, there is a section called &quot;Workers &amp; Pages&quot;. Click on it.</li>
<li>Go to your Worker, click on the &quot;Triggers&quot;, you&#39;ll see a custom domain section, click on the &quot;Add Custom Domain&quot; button. Input the domain name and you&#39;re done!</li>
<li>Remember to replace the Endpoint in the R2 Uploader with the custom domain.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For R2:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Dashboard</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the left panel, there is a section called &quot;R2&quot;. Click on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to your bucket, click on the &quot;Settings&quot;, find &quot;Custom Domains&quot; section, and then click on the &quot;Connect Domain&quot; button. Input the domain name just like you did in the Workers, and you&#39;re done!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remember to update the <strong>Custom Domain</strong> in the R2 Uploader with <strong>the R2 custom domain</strong>.</p>
<p>Attention! This time, instead of changing the Endpoint field in the R2 Uploader, we change the Custom Domain field with the R2 custom domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://r2-cf-api.jw1.dev/endpoint.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds a little bit complicated, let me break it down for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a custom domain for Workers is the simplest way to work with R2 Uploader</li>
</ul>
<h3>Running/Testing with Docker (and optionally, ngrok) üêã</h3>
<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/spurin">@spurin</a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>build an image from the source code directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">docker build -t r2-uploader
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Run the image as a container</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">docker run --name r2-uploader -p 7896:7896 r2-uploader
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Optional, use ngrok to route a reverse proxy domain, mitigates cross origin failures when running locally</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell"># Install ngrok, see ngrok.com
ngrok config add-authtoken &lt;your_token&gt;
ngrok http http://localhost:7896
# Navigate to the url provided
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Cleanup</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">docker stop r2-uploader
docker rm r2-uploader
docker rmi r2-uploader
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Hidden features üòú</h3>
<ol>
<li>You can copy a file from your system and then paste it into the uploader, it will automatically queue the file and ready to be uploaded.</li>
<li>To edit the name of queued files, just click on the file name.</li>
<li>Rename the file like <code>folder/file.txt</code> will upload the <code>file.txt</code> to the folder, you&#39;ll get a folder structure in your bucket.</li>
</ol>
